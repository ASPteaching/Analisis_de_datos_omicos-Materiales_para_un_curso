	abstract = "Identification of new prognostic factors for colon cancer with no lymph node involvement may improve the selection of patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using gene expression profiling for this purpose. Fifty patients operated on for stage II colon cancer were included. Twenty-five of these patients relapsed, while the other 25 remained disease-free for at least 5 years. MRNA was extracted from fresh-frozen biopsies and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133A. One thousand six hundred random splits of the 50 patients into a training set and a validation set were considered. For each split, a prognostic combination was derived from the training set (selection of the 30 genes most differentially expressed between patients who recurred and those who did not, by linear discriminant analysis), and its prognostic performance was assessed with the validation set. On average, accuracy was 76\%, sensitivity 85\%, and specificity 68\%. A total of 6,124 genes were included in at least one of the 1,600 predictive combinations, and 55 genes were included in more than 100 combinations. This study supports the possibility of predicting the prognosis of non-metastatic colon cancer by tumor gene expression profiling. It also shows the highly variable gene composition of predictive combinations.",

We present a method for analyzing microarray data that is predicated on biological pathway and function knowledge as opposed to a purely data-driven initial analysis. From an analysis perspective, this methodology takes advantage of information that is available across genes on a single array, as well as differences in those patterns across measurements. By using biological knowledge in the initial analysis, the accuracy and robustness of microarray profile classification is enhanced, especially when low numbers of samples are available. For clinical studies, particularly Phase I or {I/II} studies, this technique is exceptionally advantageous.",

Different estimators of background, and various model-based processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments. RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression is known, eight different background correction alternatives are compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data. AVAILABILITY: The background correction methods compared in this article are available in the R package limma (Smyth, 2005) from http://www.bioconductor.org.

The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise variability. RESULTS: A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small.

The experimental design incorporates two novel features. First, to obtain accurate estimates of false-positive and false-negative rates, 100-200 RNAs are spiked in at each fold-change level of interest, ranging from 1.2 to 4-fold. Second, instead of using an uncharacterized background RNA sample, a set of 2,551 RNA species is used as the constant (1x) set, allowing us to know whether any given probe set is truly present or absent. Application of a large number of analysis methods to this dataset reveals clear variation in their ability to identify differentially expressed genes. False-negative and false-positive rates are minimized when the following options are chosen: subtracting nonspecific signal from the PM probe intensities; performing an intensity-dependent normalization at the probe set level; and incorporating a signal intensity-dependent standard deviation in the test statistic.CONCLUSIONS:A best-route combination of analysis methods is presented that allows detection of approximately 70\% of true positives before reaching a 10\% false-discovery rate. We highlight areas in need of improvement, including better estimate of false-discovery rates and decreased false-negative rates.",

The experimental design incorporates two novel features. First, to obtain accurate estimates of false-positive and false-negative rates, 100-200 RNAs are spiked in at each fold-change level of interest, ranging from 1.2 to 4-fold. Second, instead of using an uncharacterized background RNA sample, a set of 2,551 RNA species is used as the constant (1x) set, allowing us to know whether any given probe set is truly present or absent. Application of a large number of analysis methods to this dataset reveals clear variation in their ability to identify differentially expressed genes. False-negative and false-positive rates are minimized when the following options are chosen: subtracting nonspecific signal from the PM probe intensities; performing an intensity-dependent normalization at the probe set level; and incorporating a signal intensity-dependent standard deviation in the test statistic.CONCLUSIONS:A best-route combination of analysis methods is presented that allows detection of approximately 70\% of true positives before reaching a 10\% false-discovery rate. We highlight areas in need of improvement, including better estimate of false-discovery rates and decreased false-negative rates.",

	abstract = "Development, maturation and ripening of fruits has received considerable experimental attention, primarily due to the uniqueness of such processes to plant species and the importance of fruit as a significant aspect of human dietary intake and nutrition. Molecular and genetic analysis of fruit development, and especially ripening of fleshy fruits, has resulted in significant gains in knowledge over recent years, especially with respect to understanding ethylene biosynthesis and response, cell wall metabolism and, to a lesser extent, environmental cues which impact ripening. Tomato has proved to be an excellent model system for the analysis of fruit ripening and development, in part due to the availability of well characterized ripening mutants. Especially interesting are the non‐allelic ripening‐inhibitor (rin) and non‐ripening (nor) mutations which result in non‐ripening fruit. Fruit from both mutants are deficient in climacteric respiration and the associated burst in ethylene biosynthesis. Exogenous ethylene does not restore ripening yet does induce expression of ethylene‐regulated ripening genes, suggesting both mutations block necessary aspects of ripening outside the realm of ethylene’s influence. Both mutations therefore represent genes upstream of ethylene control and additional non‐ethylene mediated aspects of ripening. Both genes have recently been isolated through positional cloning strategies and it was shown that ripening is regulated, in part, by a MADS‐box transcription factor at the rin locus. Recent development of tools for tomato genomics summarized here have further expanded the potential of the tomato system for the elucidation of genetic regulatory components impacting fruit development, ripening and nutritional quality.",

	pages = "4660--71",
	abstract = "Previous microarray studies on breast cancer identified multiple tumour classes, of which the most prominent, named luminal and basal, differ in expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha gene (ER). We report here the identification of a group of breast tumours with increased androgen signalling and a 'molecular apocrine' gene expression profile. Tumour samples from 49 patients with large operable or locally advanced breast cancers were tested on Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays. Principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering split the tumours into three groups: basal, luminal and a group we call molecular apocrine. All of the molecular apocrine tumours have strong apocrine features on histological examination (P=0.0002). The molecular apocrine group is androgen receptor (AR) positive and contains all of the ER-negative tumours outside the basal group. Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing indicates that oestrogen signalling is most active in the luminal group, and androgen signalling is most active in the molecular apocrine group. ERBB2 amplification is commoner in the molecular apocrine than the other groups. Genes that best split the three groups were identified by Wilcoxon test. Correlation of the average expression profile of these genes in our data with the expression profile of individual tumours in four published breast cancer studies suggest that molecular apocrine tumours represent 8-14\% of tumours in these studies. Our data show that it is possible with microarray data to divide mammary tumour cells into three groups based on steroid receptor activity: luminal (ER+ AR+), basal (ER- AR-) and molecular apocrine (ER- AR+).",
